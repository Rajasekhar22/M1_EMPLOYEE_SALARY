## PROCEDURE

*   At the start of the programme, the main function has a switch case.
*   '1' is pressed to login as an authorized user.
*   '2' is pressed to Register a user after the login of previous user is done.
*   'default' - If any other key is pressed it exits from the program.
*   It gives a chance if the user password is incorrect during login. 
    
    * If the password is incorrect again, the programme exits.

*   Following registration, the call function is invoked.
*   The add Details() method is now called by the call functionÂ to add the details.
*   The calculations take place in parallel, and the results are saved in separate files.

=>REG()

*   Each registered user's password is saved in a FILE in.txt format in this function.
